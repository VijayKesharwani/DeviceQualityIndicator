  title: Device Quality Indicator Subscriptions
  description: |
    This API allows the customer to subscribe to quality indicator events related to device network status, including connectivity, speed, data volume thresholds, and network type or quality changes.

    # Introduction

    ## Device Quality Indicator Subscriptions

    API consumers are able to receive notifications regarding changes in device network status, including its availability, network type, data volume usage, and network quality, as well as congestion events.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication. At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier assigned by the mobile network operator for the device.

    # API Functionality

    The API exposes the following capabilities:

    ## Device Quality Indicator Subscriptions

    These endpoints allow management of event subscriptions on device quality indicators. The CAMARA subscription model follows the CloudEvents specification.

    When subscribing, it is mandatory to provide the event `types` you are subscribing to, as multiple subscription types are managed by this API.

    The following event `types` are managed for this API:
      - `org.camaraproject.device-quality-indicator-subscriptions.v0.quality-connected-sms`: Event triggered when the device is connected to the network via SMS usage.
      - `org.camaraproject.device-quality-indicator-subscriptions.v0.quality-connected-data`: Event triggered when the device is connected to the network via data usage.
      - `org.camaraproject.device-quality-indicator-subscriptions.v0.quality-not-connected`: Event triggered when the device is no longer connected to the network.
      - `org.camaraproject.device-quality-indicator-subscriptions.v0.network-type-change`: Event triggered when the device changes its network type (e.g., from 4G to 5G).
      - `org.camaraproject.device-quality-indicator-subscriptions.v0.network-quality`: Event triggered when there is a change in the device’s network quality (e.g., low, medium, high network quality).
      - `org.camaraproject.device-quality-indicator-subscriptions.v0.network-congestion`: Event triggered when the network experiences congestion affecting the device.
      - `org.camaraproject.device-quality-indicator-subscriptions.v0.data-volume`: Event triggered when the device reaches certain data usage thresholds (e.g., 50%, 75%, 90% of the data plan used).

    Note: Additionally, the event `org.camaraproject.device-quality-indicator-subscriptions.v0.subscription-ends` is sent when the subscription ends. This notification does not require a dedicated subscription.

    ### Notifications callback

    This endpoint describes the event notification received on the subscriber's callback URL when the event occurs. Detailed descriptions of the event notifications are provided in the CAMARA API design guideline document.

    **WARNING**: The callback endpoint must be exposed by the consumer as `POST /{$request.body#/sink}`. Developers should provide a callback URL to receive notifications regarding device quality indicator status from the service provider.

        The developer can choose to provide the below specified device identifiers:

        * `phoneNumber`
        * `networkAccessIdentifier`

        NOTE: the MNO might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different MNOs. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.

    PhoneNumber:
      description: A public identifier addressing a telephone subscription. In mobile networks it corresponds to the MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number).

      pattern: '^\+[1-9][0-9]{4,14}$'
      example: "+123456789"

    NetworkAccessIdentifier:
      description: A public identifier addressing a subscription in a mobile network. In 3GPP terminology, it corresponds to the GPSI formatted with the External Identifier ({Local Identifier}@{Domain Identifier}). Unlike the telephone number, the network access identifier is not subjected to portability ruling in force, and is individually managed by each operator.
      type: string
      example: "123456789@domain.com"

    DeviceIpv4Addr:
      type: object
      description: |
        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.

        publicAddress:

        either they all use the actual time of the occurrence or they all use the same algorithm to determine the value used.
        It must follow [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6) and must have time zone.
        Recommended format is yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ (i.e. which allows 2023-07-03T14:27:08.312+02:00 or 2023-07-03T12:27:08.312Z)
